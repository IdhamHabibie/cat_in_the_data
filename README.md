# cat_in_the_data
Based on Kaggle Competitions, https://www.kaggle.com/c/cat-in-the-dat-ii/overview/description, I have developed a formula that used to predict the cat in the data 
based on nominal data, ordinal data, and binary data. 

In this tutorial, I am using a Random Forest, and PCA to analyse this information.
